        <p>I'm Chancy Leath. For the last 18 years I've worked as a product manager, project management support 
        in the telecommunications industry. Now I'm looking to take on new challenges by learning web development.</p>
        <p>On a personal note, I grew up on a 1000 acre ranch in northwestern Wyoming, and now find myself
        owning a 10 acre mini ranch of my own (after many years of trying to escape country living, I longed for it!)
        I joke that in my spare time that I'm going to start a mini cattle ranch (you know miniature cows, and 
        wrangle them using a miniature horse and my 8 pound Morkie dog, named Charlemagne) but for now its just nice 
        to have some wide open spaces.</p>
        <p>Besides wanting to run a mini cattle ranch, I also enjoy camping, 4 wheeling, hiking, cooking, and 
        reading (and drinking pina coladas, long walks on the beach...oh wait...).</p>
